			<p id="body">Hey! You have stumbled across my site; my PW Portfolio. 
    	Everything I have learned thus far in my major is condensed into a few pieces to
		highlight what I have learned and how I have grown in my writing. You will find a 
		page with my written works that shows the different genres I have learned an an
		improvement in my ability to analyse a text and back up my findings with textual 
		evidence. There is also a page about my activities outside my 
		major called "Extracurricular", one about myself on a more personal level called 
		"Bio", and a page with my resume called "Resume". Feel free to poke
		around and check out my site. I hope you find something that interests you and piques
		your curiosity!</p>

			<h4>Biography</h4>
			<img src="seniorpic_profilephoto.jpg"/><img id="profilephoto"/>
			<p>Welcome to my Bio page where you get to learn a little more about me! I am
    	a Professional Writing (PW) major and I came from a town whose high school was called
		Pewamo-Westphalia (PW). So when my college advisor asked me why I wanted to be a 
		PW major I obviously felt it was meant to be (but not really), let's rewind a bit. Ever
		since I was little I have loved to read. I begged my mom to teach me to read and I loved 
		reading to my classmates and aunts and uncles. You can imagine my mother was a bit
		enthused and vexed when I made a long distance phone call to Texas (back when landlines
		were the most popular form of communication) just to read a story to my aunt. Sometime
		in early elementary school I started to write my own stories. In sixth grade I had my 
		own short story published, which was exciting. I have a deep desire to write books 
		that take one on an adventure.</p>
